A tool to take a snapshot of an ncloth or nucleus node. Given snapshots and a
playblast, you can more easily track / judge the effect of specific attributes.

Future plans: Support animated attributes, dynamic constraints, and collision
objects to get a full scene snapshot.

snapshot - Need to select a working directory. Select nodes to generate
snapshot files for. A snapshot file is a simple text file with: 

attribute:value:type

diff_snapshot - Choose two snapshot files for same kind of node
(ncloth | nucleus) and it will display the attributes with different values

Use at your own risk, I do not assume any liability for anything that might go
wrong when using this code.

USE:
from cloth_snapshot.tool import ui
ui.ui()
